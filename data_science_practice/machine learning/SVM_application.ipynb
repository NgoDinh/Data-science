    "# What is SVM\n",
    "We plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well\n",
    "- process: original sample -(kernel function)-> feature space --> find hyperplanes -->maximize the margin around the separating --> best hyperplane\n",

    "- Margin: distance from support vector to hyperplane\n",
    "- Kernel function: The process of rearranging the objects for optimal separation. It help us mapping original sample to feature space of a higher dimension\n",
    "- slack variables: An additional set of coefficients are introduced that give the margin wiggle room in each dimension.  These coefficients are sometimes called slack variables\n",

    "- Numerical Inputs: SVM assumes that your inputs are numeric.  If you have categorical inputs you may need to covert them to binary dummy variables (one variable for each category).\n",
    "- Binary Classification: Basic SVM as described in this chapter is intended for binary(two-class) classification problems.  Although, extensions have been developed for regression and multiclass classification.\n",
