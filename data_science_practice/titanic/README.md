# Before learn
#### How to learn - 3F
- Focus: Need to know where to go and focus on it.
- Free: Feel free with any new things, don't worry, I will learn it later but not now. We can't get any thing without focus.
- Fluency: You will forget atleast 70% if you break and countinue after few days. Note: practice follow process.
#### Learning process:
- Learn from 3 books (Mastery(concepts) - In action(Python) - Easy with R (R)).
- Build a personal project
- Learn about confusing key words.
# Summary about machine learning:
This section just introduce common keywords in machine learning, follow it you can find a good source to learn.
#### Machine Learning
Making machines get better at some task by learning from data, instead of having to explicitly code rules.
#### Types of ML systems: 
- Supervised or unsupervised
- Classification regression and clustering
- Batch or online
- Instance-based or model-based, and so on.
#### Challenge:
- Training set is too small, or if the data is not representative, noisy
- Polluted with irrelevant features (garbage in, garbage out). 
- Neither too simple (in which case it will underfit) nor too complex (in which case it will overfit).
# Data science process:
1. Look at the big picture: Frame the problem, Select a Performance Measure
3. Get data and visualize the data to gain insights.For what?
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
